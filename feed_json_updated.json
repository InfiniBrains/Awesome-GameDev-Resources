If you fall into the typical box, don't worry: you are not alone. The game industry is filled with neurodivergent people, and it is a place where you can be yourself, be accepted, and thrive. But if you are a typical person, you should be at least aware of the differences and how to deal with them.</p>\n<p>IGDA (International Game Developers Association) ran a research in 2023 about disability and they found a shocking number of 44% of game professionals holds some degree of neurodivergence.
